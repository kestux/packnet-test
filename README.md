# packnet-test

Hello, here follows my test task for Packnet. The code will never intend to bee 100% working, 
will only show the structure of the project I'd done.

It will be symfony project run by CLI command `bin/console server:run` and accessed by http://127.0.0.1:8000/

I'm making all DB fields nullable to make my work easier now. 
In the real life I would never make such fields like album title, artist, etc nullable.
